I am a global citizen currently living in Berlin. I serve as the Director-General and President of the Global Citizenship Foundations in the EU and India. In addition, I have the privilege of being part of the International Advisory Board of Dublin City University's Educational Disadvantage Centre. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Public Policy degree at the Hertie School. Throughout my career, I have worked as an educator and social entrepreneur, with a strong passion for Hybrid Learning, Global Sustainability, Social and Emotional Learning, Debate Education, and Global Citizenship Education. Personally, I firmly believe in harnessing the power of data for the betterment of society.
