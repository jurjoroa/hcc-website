Initially a lawyer with experience in criminal law, strategic litigation, and public law, I've now developed a strong passion for harnessing data analysis and data science to serve the public good. My diverse roles have included Research Assistant at the Hertie School Data Science Lab, Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley, Attorney at Conectas Human Rights, and Chief Advisor at the Penitentiary Administration in Maranhão, Brazil. 


My multidisciplinary background in law, public policy, and public management drives me to address complex social challenges such as public security, access to justice, and enhancing government effectiveness. I'm particularly fascinated with natural language processing (NLP), data wrangling, and web scraping as they enable me to extract valuable insights from intricate data sources. I'm always eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals to create innovative solutions that leave a lasting, positive impact on communities worldwide, with a special focus on Latin America.
