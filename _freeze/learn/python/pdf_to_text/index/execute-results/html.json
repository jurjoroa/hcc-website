For example: organizations, governments, universities, and businesses use themas tools to publish data. Just imagine this: I've often seen governments publish their data in pdfs as tables. As a public policy maker or as a data analyst, that can be painful; imagine translate all that information by hand or using paid tools as PDFTables or Convert from PDF to Excel online. This is where Python and the `pdfplumber` and `tabulate` libraries comes in handy: it allows us to extract text, tables, and other data from PDF files with ease, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and processing. I would also add that this skill is useful as a crucial step for Natural Language Processing since a lot of potential inputs right now are just in pdf texts. \n\nIn the next lines, I'll show how we can extract text from PDF documents that also includes tables. This approach is easy to understand and reliable, so, anyone can posses and domain this skill; you just need a little bit of knowledge about Python and how we can work with objects.\n\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Important\n\nThe next approach applies only to PDF documents that have text inside and are not scanned documents. If you have a pdf document that are scanned text, then Optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms are necessary to realize this task. This method can be implemented in another entry within the Hertie Coding Club.\n:::\n\n\n \n\nIf you are working within your Python environment, please install this packages. Otherwise, I'll give you the google collab where you can run Python code without installing it in your computer.\n\n::: callout-important\n## Checkout\n\nIf you are running the code locally, please be sure that you have installed the latest Java version since tabulate works within this framework. `tabulate` library uses Java to render the results.\n:::\n\n\n## Install packages\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npip install pdfplumber #Library used to extract text from pdf documents\npip install pandas #Library to manipulate dataframes\npip install tabula-py tabulate #Library to extract tables from PDF documents. \n```\n:::\n\n\n## Extract data from a PDF document\n\n\nThis is the [document](https://www.hertie-school.org/fileadmin/1_Study/11_Scholarships_FinancialAid/US_loans/03_MPP_Study__Examination___Admission_Rules.pdf) that we will use to this example. It's a document from the Hertie School that describes the Study, Examination, and Admission Rules in 2016 for the MPP program. Here our goal will be extract all the content from it and put it in a dataframe. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#Import libraries\nimport pdfplumber as pp\nimport pandas as pd\n\n#Set PDF file name\npdf = 'MPP_Study_Example.pdf'\n\n#Open PDF file and extract data from each page\nwith pp.open(pdf) as book:\n    #Initialize an empty list to store text\n    page_data = []\n    #Loop over each page in the PDF file\n    for page_no, page in enumerate(book.pages, start = 1):\n        #Extract text from page\n        data = page.extract_text()\n        #Append page data to list\n        page_data.append([pdf, data.strip(), page_no])\n\n#Create pandas DataFrame from page data and set column names\ndf_text = pd.DataFrame(page_data, columns=['file_name', 'text', 'page_number'])\n\n#Display DataFrame\nprint(df_text)\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n               file_name                                               text   \n0  MPP_Study_Example.pdf  Master of Public Policy\\nStudy, Examination, a...  \\\n1  MPP_Study_Example.pdf  I.

The first one shows the document's name where we extracted the text. The second column contains the text, and the third one the number of pages. Of course, you can modify the code and the variable names according to your necessities. \n\n\nIf you want to save your dataframe, remember this functions:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Save the dataframe to a CSV file\ndf_text.to_csv('df_text_pdf.csv', index=False)\n\n# Save the dataframe to an Excel file\ndf_text.to_excel('df_text_pdf.xlsx', index=False)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you look close, there is a table in page number 5. `PDFplumber` renders that as text and not in a table format. One approach to this would be use now the `tabulate` library to extract exclsuively tables from our document. The table inside the document is not clear or doesn't have a completely table format. However, we can still apply our function to extract that table and approach it to a nice table format. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#Import required libraries\nimport tabula\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tabula import read_pdf\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n#Set the path to the PDF file\npdf_path = 'MPP_Study_Example.pdf'\n\n#Read all tables from the PDF file into a list of DataFrames\ndf_list = tabula.read_pdf(pdf_path, pages=\"all\", multiple_tables=True)\n\n#Print the list of DataFrames\nprint(df_list)\n\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[    (2)   \n0   NaN  \\\n1   (3)   \n2   NaN   \n3   NaN   \n4   NaN   \n5   NaN   \n6   (4)   \n7   NaN   \n8   NaN   \n9   (5)   \n10  NaN   \n11  (6)   \n12  NaN   \n13  NaN   \n14  NaN   \n15  (7)   \n16  NaN   \n17  NaN   \n18  (8)   \n\n   The Academic Senate of the Hertie School of Governance elects the faculty members for a  \n0   two-year term and the student representative f...                                       \n1   The Examination Committee meets in camera and ...                                       \n2   the Committee are obliged to maintain secrecy ...                                       \n3   them in their capacity as members of the Commi...                                       \n4   individual students.

Generally, we need another tool to extract a table from a document since it will be much easier because of the `tabula` library it's trained just to recognize tables. Now, we will use another document with cleaner tables, and the library can work even better. We will use a [document](https://sedl.org/afterschool/toolkits/science/pdf/ast_sci_data_tables_sample.pdf) that contains text but also much cleaner tables. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport tabula\nfrom tabula import read_pdf\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\ndf_list_example2 = tabula.read_pdf('ast_sci_data_tables_sample.pdf', \n                                    pages=\"all\", multiple_tables = True)\n\n#We use len to determine how many tables the document has\nlen(df_list_example2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```\n3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe have for tables.

Asou can see, the process was much straight forward. In conclusion, this is just one approach of multiple ones since there are different libraries depending of what you want to do. However, I like this libraries since are easy to understand. Finally, if you want to reproduce this code, here I leave a Google Colab notebook for you to input your pdf's and get the text out of it. This step is super interesting and I would say necessary to start a pipeline for NLP models, analysis of text, etc. \n\n\n \n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n[<img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" width=\"250\">](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qBVCIpBReACYi1Pi81bOWZNw66XsY2mA?usp=sharing)\n</div>\n\n \n \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Reference\nCite this page: Roa, J.
